# System Identification with Neural Networks
This repos aims to replicate this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2016.05.012) by Tarek A. Tutunji. <br>
To be simple, the researcher said that mathematical model of a system (ex. DC Motor, Car Dampener System, Distillation System) can be identified via Neural Network design, and it's parameter is derived from the NN weights.
