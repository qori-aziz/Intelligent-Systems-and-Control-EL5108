# 1 - Perceptron
This folder contains realization of perceptron without using library.
This aims to give basic understanding abotu the weight and bias updating process of a simple perceptron neural networks

## Languages
 - Jupyter notebook .ipynb

## Contains
 1. Simple Perceptron
    Realization of a single-layer perceptron to classify input to binary classes
 2. XOR and Auto-Associative Memory
    - Realization of XOR gate. Because of its structure, we must use 2-layer perceptron to classify it.
    - Auto-associative memory. Design auto-associative memory that can restore distorted digit images with Hebb learning rule.
